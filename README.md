## Overview
QuLabEDU is a series of hands-on labs in quantum information science built for a range of education backgrounds. Each lab is a jupyter-notebook intended to be run via Amazon Web Service's cloud quantum computing platform, Braket. These notebooks consist of an introduction and a series of code-blocks and questions that are answered in real-time.

## Usage
- Create an AWS account with access to Braket.
- Initialize a notebook on Braket.
    - Login to AWS -> Amazon Braket -> Notebooks -> Create notebook instance
    - When creating notebook instance, use Git Repository options to clone this repository 'https://github.com/Kenny-Heitritter/QuLabEDU.git'
- Go to the labs folder in your initialized Notebook and select your desired lab.

## Current Labs
##### <Q|1> - The Stern-Gerlach Experiment

## Roadmap
- Complete graduate-level version of <Q|1>
- Create general scaffolding for lab creation
- Develop future labs based around the following:
    - Rabi oscillations
    - Entanglement, Bell states (2 qubits)
    - Quantum teleportation, usage in error correction
    - Trotterized version of MRI
    - Renyi entropy from twin copies
    - Measure phase shifts in one dimension
    - Preparation of configurable Rydberg arrays
    - Phase diagram of Rydberg atom ladders
