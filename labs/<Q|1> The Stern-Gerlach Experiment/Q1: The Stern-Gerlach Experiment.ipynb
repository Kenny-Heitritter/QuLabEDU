    "## Introduction\n",
    "The following experiment was first conceived by Otto Stern in 1921 and thereafter carried out by Walther Gerlach in 1922. The original experiment used a beam of silver atoms traveling through inhomogeneous magnetic fields and screens to show that the electron has an inherent angular momentum (spin) that is quantized. The experiment is also able to show properties of quantum measurement and display facets of the uncertainty principle. This notebook will allow you to use both a classical simulator a genuine quantum computer to manipulate qubits and carry out the Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a little background on the physics of this experiment. If you have learned about the physics of magnetic fields, you likely encountered the concept of the magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$. The simplest way to define $\\vec{\\mu}$ is to picture a loop of current as shown in Figure 1.\n",

    "    <figcaption>Figure 1: Magnetic dipole moment of a loop of current. [1]</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "he loop of current has an associated direction and that direction gives us a notion of an area vector. To determine the direction, we use the right hand rule. Multiplying the current and the area vector gives the definition of the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}=I\\vec{A}$. Rather than explicitly defining the magnetic moment using the current, we could instead imagine the current to be a loop of constant linear charge density $\\lambda$ rotating at a constant speed $v$. From this, we could write $I=\\lambda v$. Since the loop is a circle, we could be explicit about $\\lambda$ and write $\\lambda=\\frac{Q}{2\\pi R}$. All together, $I=\\frac{Q}{2\\pi R} v$. We could now put this into the definition of our magnetic moment, along with the fact that the area of a loop is $A=\\pi R^2$, so that $\\vec{\\mu}=\\frac{Q}{2\\pi R}v\\cdot \\pi R^2 \\hat{n}=\\frac{1}{2}QvR \\hat{n}$, where $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector pointing out of the loop. Recall from your physics 1 class that an object orbiting about a position has an associated angular momentum given by $\\vec{L}=m \\vec{v}\\times \\vec{r}$. Assume for now that the $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{r}$ are perpendicular so that we can express the magnitude of the angular momentum as $L=|\\vec{L}|=mvR$. We notice that $L/m=vR$ and $vR$ is an expression appearing in the magnetic moment. Therefore, we can substitute the angular momentum into the magnetic moment to find $\\mu =\\frac{Q}{2m} L$. This simple but profound statement tells us that an object with angular momentum, mass, and charge has an associated magnetic moment.\n",
    "The specific object we will consider in this lab is an electron for which we might guess a magnetic dipole moment of $\\mu = \\frac{e}{2m_e} S$. Here, we denote the electron's angular momentum by $S$ because it is referred to as spin angular momentum. The reason for giving this a different name should make sense as we move forward. Physicists usually prefer to write this magnetic dipole moment using $\\hbar$ (Planck's reduced constant) as $\\mu = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\frac{S}{\\hbar}$, though it is the same expression. The reason for writing it this way is that $\\frac{S}{\\hbar}$ has no units and $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ has units of magnetic dipole moment and is called the Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$). Though we are close to correct in writing the magnetic moment in this way, there actually exists a multiplicative constant $g$ called the Lande g-factor that multiplies the expression so that $\\mu = -g\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\frac{S}{\\hbar}$. For the electron, this g-factor ends up being $2$ but won't explain much more about that at this level. All together now, we can write the magnetic dipole moment of the electron as $\\vec{\\mu}=-2\\mu_B \\frac{\\vec{S}}{\\hbar}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning about the physics of electric and magnetic fields, you learned that a charged particle moving in a magnetic field feels a force according to $\\vec{F}=q \\vec{v}\\times \\vec{B}$. If the magnetic field applied is inhomogeneous in the sense of Figure 2 then we see that a circling electron will feel an upward force. \n",

    "    <img src=\"./imgs/dipole_force_diagram.png\" width=300 height=500 />\n",
    "    <figcaption>Figure 2: a: Inhomogenous magnetic field applied to a loop of current. b: Forces felt due to inhomogenous magnetic field. [2]</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Since a circling electron is the same as a loop of current going the opposite direction, and a loop of current has a magnetic dipole moment, we can abstract away the circling electron and find that a magnetic dipole feels an upward or downward force in an inhomogeneous field. The direction of the force will depend on the orientation of the magnetic moment relative to the inhomogeneous field. Due to this force, a dipole with some initial velocity perpendicular to the direction of the inhomogeneous magnetic field will be deflected when moving through an inhomogeneous magnetic field. This dipole deflection was exactly the physics Stern and Gerlach intended to test in their experiment. The experiment uses silver atoms, which has 47 electrons of which 46 are in entirely filled shells and the last electron is in a shell with angular momentum of zero. Therefore, by sending silver atoms through inhomogeneous magnetic fields, one can test the inherent magnetic dipole moment of the electron. The basic setup used by Stern and Gerlach was as pictured in Figure 3.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "As the silver atoms are thermally excited out of the furnace their orientations, and therefore the electron's magnetic dipole moments, should be randomly oriented. If the electron's magnetic dipole moment were a classical quantity then one would expect the random orientations to encounter the magnetic field and be deflected at continuous angles corresponding to their orientation. With enough electrons, one would classically expect a screen placed on the other side of the magnetic field to show a continuous line showing where electrons hit the screen. What Stern and Gerlach found was something quite different - the electrons were only deflected into two points. This experiment showed that the inherent magnetic dipole moment and thus angular momentum (spin) of the electron is not a classical quantity and instead can take only one of two states. These two states can be labeled as up and down and are only explainable in terms of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the experiment of Stern and Gerlach, the world learned that the spin angular momentum of the electron is quantum mechanical property and, upon measurement, can exist only in one of two states. In the realm of quantum information science, we refer to any two state quantum mechanical system as a qubit. The term qubit is derived from the classical bit, a value of 0 or 1, which all normal computers operate on. In this lab, we will work with qubits to display the same types of physics that Stern and Gerlach were able to demonstrate using silver atoms. Most of the code we will run in this notebook will simulate how qubits work using classical bits but there will be sections where you have the opportunity to submit code to run on a real quantum computer. Though we can simulate how qubits work for small numbers of qubits, this simulation becomes effectively impossible for larger numbers of qubits. Everything in this lab will utilize small single qubits and can thus be effectively simulated.\n",

    "At this point, you should have a basic understanding of how to think about and measure qubits. Now we want to use qubits to implement the Stern-Gerlach experiment. This was a foundational experiment that experimentally proved a consequence of quantum mechanics, that the electron possesses a type of angular momentum called 'spin' that is quantized. This means that the electron has an associated variable called 'spin' that can be in a state of either up or down when we measure it. If we prepare an electron without measuring its spin, then the spin can be in some superposition of up and down. This is exactly like we saw previously when we described qubits that were some combination of up and down states. In fact, we can think of the spin of the electron as being a qubit since a qubit is just a two state quantum system. We want to show that by thinking of the electron as a qubit, and implementing the same procedure as in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, that we reproduce the same results. If we are are able to show the same results then we conclude that the electron's spin angular momentum has the same physics as a qubit and, most importantly, obeys the laws of quantum mechanics."

    "Pictured below in figure 4 is the first of the Stern-Gerlach experiments, where a silver atom with an electron in a random spin state is fed into the left-hand side of the picture. The atom is fed into a z-direction inhomogenous magnetic field after which the down states are covered up while the up states are fed into another z-direction inhomogeneous magnetic field. This experiment initially showed that a state initially measured to be in either up or down state remains in that state upon another of the same type of measurement. If the first measurement produced an up state from the z-direction magnetic field then the second measurement will also produce an up state from the z-direction magnetic field.\n",

    " In the original experiment, the electron spin state was generated by thermally ejecting hot silver atoms from an oven. This randomly oriented spin state passes into a device originally implemented as an inhomogeneous magnetic field in the z-direction. Since the spin of the electron and the magnetic field have an interaction, we expect that measurements on the right-hand side of the magnetic field device will be discretely split into two spots. We expect this because we know from Stern and Gerlach's results that the electron has spin that, when measured, must be either up or down. Since the different spin states are deflected differently by the magnetic field, one spot is due to the up spin and the other spot would be due to the down spin state. If we feed many randomly oriented electrons into this first magnetic field, we expect that roughly 50% will end up deflected up and 50% will be deflected down. This is exactly the Stern-Gerlach experiment's first and most surprising result. If the spin of the electron were not quantized and could take on any value/orientation, we would expect the measurement on the other size of the magnetic field to be a continuous distribution. Here, we are able to represent the deflection by a z-direction magnetic field of a spin up or spin down qubit by simply measuring the state. We now carry out the first part of the experiment in Figure 4, where we send randomly oriented spins into a z-direction magnetic field."

To implement this first experiment using qubits, we will first rotate the intial up qubit by $\\pi/2$ in the y-direction then measure the state of qubit.

    "In this experiment, we send a qubit through three magnetic fields. The first in the z-direction, the second in the x-direction, and the third in the z-direction. After going through the first z-direction magnetic field, we take only the spin up states to send into the x-direction magnetic field. We then take the spin up states from the x-direction magnetic field to send into the third z-direction magnetic field. From the previous experiment, we may have thought that the qubit was now in a state of both up in the x-direction and up in the z-direction. Therefore, measuring the z-direction again would obviously yield another up spin state. This turns out to not be the case and teaches us another important lesson about quantum mechanics. The lesson it teaches us is that there are properties of a quantum system that cannot be measured simultaneously. In this experiment, it turns out that the x-direction measurement destroys the information about the first z-direction measurement. This is a feature of something called the uncertainty principle. When the spin exits the x-direction magnetic field, it has no memory of what it's z-direction spin state was and thus when it goes through another z-direction magnetic field we get a 50/50 probability of the spin state being up or down. Let's show how we can implement this using qubits so you can see the results for yourself."
